Readme
This code focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather data from Hawaii. The dataset, stored in an SQLite database, includes information about weather stations and their measurements. The code performs the following tasks:

Data Preparation:

Connects to the "hawaii.sqlite" database.
Retrieves the table names and displays them.
Maps the tables to classes using SQLAlchemy's automap functionality.
Creates a session to interact with the database.
Precipitation Analysis:

Retrieves the most recent date from the dataset.
Calculates the date one year ago from the most recent date.
Queries the precipitation data for the last 12 months.
Converts the data into a DataFrame and visualizes it as a line plot.
Displays summary statistics of the precipitation data.
Station Analysis:

Calculates the total number of stations in the dataset.
Identifies the most active stations based on the number of observations.
Calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperature for the most active station.
Retrieves the temperature observations for the last 12 months for the most active station.
Visualizes the temperature data as a histogram.
The code demonstrates skills in working with databases, querying data, data manipulation with Pandas, and data visualization using Matplotlib. It provides valuable insights into the precipitation and temperature patterns in Hawaii, aiding in weather analysis and research
